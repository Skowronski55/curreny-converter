This is my second project. This time it is a simple currency calculator that converts zlotys into euros, US dollars and francs.
Just enter the amount in zlotys in the first field, select the required currency in the second field and press the button, and you will see the result at the bottom of the screen.

Technologies and conventions used in the project:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
BEM
ES6+ Features
